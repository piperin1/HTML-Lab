  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Piper. I'm 19 years old and am currently a sophomore in the Computer Science major at BYU. On this page, you can learn more about me!</p>

<button class="accordion"><strong>Interests</strong></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>I have many interests outside of Computer Science! When I'm not doing schoolwork, I'm usually winding down by playing games. Video games are something that I've been involved with since I was eight and obsessed with Minecraft. For me, they're a nice way to relax and immerse myself into another world. Sometimes, they're also competitive or otherwise exciting. Recently, I've been getting into Elden Ring, but also enjoy Dead By Daylight, Phasmophobia, and Breath of the Wild. 
    At the end of the day, I'm really down to try any sort of game, show, or movie. While I favor the horror genre, I'm always willing to cry it out to a tragic romcom or get invested in an action film. </p>

<button class="accordion"><strong>Hobbies</strong></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>As a Computer Science student, I do enjoy programming and its other applications, but my biggest hobby is actually art and graphic design. I'm currently employed by the BYU College of Family, Home, and Social Sciences where I create posters, flyers, and more. If you see an advertisement in the KMBL tower, there's a good chance I might have designed it. 
    Before I did graphic design, I also loved to draw. Illustration is one of my biggest passions and is something I've done for almost eight years now. Unfortunately as a student, it can be hard to find time for it, but I still do my best to squeeze it into my schedule as often as possible. Once I graduate, I look forward to filling my free time with doing more of what I love.</p>

  <p>My personal life isn't adventure-filled, but it's still special to me. My family lives in Maryland, which is where I grew up. I have two biological siblings, three step-siblings, and now three pets back home! If it weren't for my step-brother, I would still be the oldest of them all. 
    In Utah, I at least get to spend time with my extended family and my best friend, Howl. It might seem like a silly name for a cat; he's actually named after a Ghibli character! Howl is my little plus-one, usually following me around my apartment and screaming at me for more food (yes, even with an automatic feeder). When the holidays come around, I'll be super excited to take him back home to Maryland with me for a little while! While my family is big, it's easy to miss them.
